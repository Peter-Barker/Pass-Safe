# Pass-Safe
A basic password manager that requires further development and eventually a usable GUI.
This is my first minor 'project' that I hope I can continually improve over time, adding a GUI and various other functions.
I am a newbie and know very little about programming, but I want to give it a shot!

I programmed it using Python 3.

There isn't much to note to be honest as it is very basic code, however, it does require a .txt document named 'Record.txt'
in the same directory as the 'Password Safe.py' file.

The password required to use the program is defaulted to 'peter', feel free to change that in the code as you desire.

Also, I have made a note in the .py file of a bit of code that needs to be swapped around depending on whether you are using 
Ubuntu OS or Windows OS. The default is set to work on Windows OS.
